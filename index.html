        <p> Welcome to Wildlife Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
            and release wildlife back into their natural enviroment. We are a nonprofit
            organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife. </p>
        <p> Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide
            long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into their natural enviroment</p>
        <p> Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals. You can also
            donate, become a member, or become a sponser. Contact us today.</p>
